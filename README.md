ðŸ©º Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the likelihood of diabetes in patients using the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM. The best model achieved ~80% accuracy and 0.82 ROC-AUC, with results visualized for better interpretability.
